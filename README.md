# Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a <em>frontend/backend web developer</em> in the heart of the Ruhr area, working for an IT company in Dortmund that mainly builds websites for clients in the public sector. I mainly work with HTML, CSS, a bit of JavaScript, JSP, Velocity and a few other things. In my private life I'm a father and husband.
