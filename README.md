# Hi! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a <i>frontend / backend web developer</i> in the heart of the Ruhr region, working for a Dortmund based IT company, mostly crafting websites for governmental / public sector clients. I use good old techniques like HTML5 and CSS3, some bits of Javascript and more backend related languages like JSP, Velocity and PHP.
