# Hi! 👋

I'm a <i>frontend / backend web developer</i> in the heart of the Ruhr region, working for a Dortmund based IT company, mostly crafting websites for governmental / public sector clients. I use good old techniques like HTML5 and CSS3, some bits of Javascript and more backend related languages like JSP, Velocity and PHP.

Find me on [𝕏](https://x.com/ohne_a), [Xing](https://www.xing.com/profile/Michel_Balzer/cv) or [LinkedIn](https://de.linkedin.com/in/michel-balzer-414563204).
